In support of Plant Village Project, we aim to help smallholder farmers grow more food by getting rid of their diseases by identifying them on time and getting valuable solutions for it.

We have an image classifier to predict plant diseases captured from a mobile camera. The models runs in the mobile itself and it does not need internet for this. 

Datasets for the challenge.
* Train: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z-zMWsxSU8jRHp3h6YWCpQZAG79SD6kd
* Test: https://drive.google.com/open?id=10idTg94ohFjhgEH5jdDBtpoCMhX4ShE9 


Files.
* prediction.json - This is our prediction for the test set given in the challenge above.
* Plant_Disease_Detection - Image Classification.ipynb - Notebook for training and testing the models.
* PlantSaverApp/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk - APK you can directly install and get started.


## Quick Start
